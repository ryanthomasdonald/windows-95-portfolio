                Thanks for taking a moment out of your busy day to travel back in time with me!

                <br />
                The <a href="original-site/index.html">1.0 version of this portfolio site</a> started its life as an "About Me" page
                from my bootcamp's prerequisite work. While the initial site had an indelible 
                amount of what I'll call "charm", I felt like its codebase simply didn't illustrate
                just how much info I've crammed into my skull starting in September of 2021.
                <br />
                <br />
                Since I had already built a browser-within-a-browser for fun, I figured that the next 
                logical step was to replicate a classic OS using the skills I've been accumulating.
                Feel free to poke around here (and in <a href="https://github.com/ryanthomasdonald/windows-95-portfolio" target="_blank">my repo</a>), as I'll continue to add functionality in the coming 
                weeks/months. (And to answer the question you may have already asked yourself, yes, 
                it runs "Doom"!)
                <br />
                <br />
                Again, thanks for stopping by and hopefully our paths will cross somewhere on down the dusty trail.
                Because after all, the wild blue yonder won't ride off into itself, pardner...
